                        <p>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were current, if not moreso in the company i joined. i honestly feel i got every penny's worth it.</p>
                        <q>I an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I have been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.

Since completing the course, i have successfully switched careers, working as a software enginner at VR startup. </q>

                        <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended! </p>
                        <q>Before joining the bootcamp i've never written a line of code. i needed some structures from professionals who can help me learn programmmimg step by step. I was encouraged to enrol by a former students of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire currriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and have never wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could have ever had. In fact, have often refeered to it during interviews as my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!</q>
